Assignment: 10.4 - Sin Cos
Date: 11/20/2022

Description:
    This program uses matplotlib to draw a plot of sine and cosine from 0 to 2Ï€ on the same axes.

Contributors:

My contributor(s) helped me:
    [ ] understand the assignment expectations without
        telling me how they will approach it.
    [ ] understand different ways to think about a solution
        without helping me plan my solution.
    [ ] think through the meaning of a specific error or
        bug present in my code without looking at my code.
    Note that if you helped somebody else with their code, you
    have to list that person as a contributor.
